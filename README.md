# Music_Store_Analysis
I'm excited to share my MySQL case study titled " ðŸŽµ ðŸŽ· Music Store Analysis ðŸŽ§"

Objective : 

The objective of analyzing a music store using MySQL is to leverage data for improving business performance. This involves identifying sales trends, best-selling products, and customer purchasing patterns, optimizing inventory management, evaluating financial health, and assessing marketing effectiveness. By using MySQL to query and analyze the store's data, the goal is to make informed decisions that enhance profitability, operational efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

DatasetðŸ“Š:

The dataset for this project has 11 tables: Employee, Customer, Invoice, Invoice-Line, Track, MediaType, Genre, Album, Artist, Playlist-Track, and Playlist, as well as their associations.

This project involves several insightful analyses, including:

1. Identifying the senior-most employee by job title.
2. Determining the countries with the most invoices.
3. Finding the top values of total invoices.
4. Pinpointing the city with the highest total invoice sum for a promotional event.
5. Highlighting the best customer based on total spending.
6. Listing all Rock Music listeners and inviting top rock artists.
7. Returning tracks longer than the average song length.
8. Calculating customer spending on artists.
9. Discovering the most popular music genre by country.
10. Identifying the top-spending customer in each country.
